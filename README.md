# Trello-RestApi-Testing


The Trello API testing project using Postman tools is a project that aims to test the functionality of Trello's API using the Postman tool. Trello is a web-based project management application that allows users to organize and prioritize their tasks in a customizable way. The API provides developers with programmatic access to the functionality of the Trello platform, enabling them to build custom integrations, applications, and workflows.

The project involves testing the Trello API using various HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The tests will cover the basic functionalities of the API such as creating boards, lists, and cards, adding members, editing and deleting boards, lists, and cards, and checking the response codes and messages.
